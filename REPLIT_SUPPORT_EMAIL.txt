ISSUE SUMMARY:
I am writing to report catastrophic billing overcharges totaling approximately $600 and the loss of deposited cryptocurrency funds due to critical system failures in my Replit project. I require IMMEDIATE assistance and a full investigation.

BILLING OVERCHARGES - TOTAL: ~$600
Despite explicitly requesting a budget-constrained bot ($5-10/month) with NO AI features, I have been charged:
- First charge: $165 (OpenAI/GPT-4o API calls that I never requested)
- Second charge: $150 (Wallet feature testing that failed)
- Third charge: $200 (Recent charges)
- Expected cost: $5-10/month
- TOTAL OVERCHARGE: ~$600

CRITICAL DATA LOSS - LOST CRYPTOCURRENCY FUNDS:
The wallet generation feature created a Solana wallet but FAILED to save the private key to the database:

Wallet Address: 6vexNEjjuygFqvQehKyDBNCZ4WRRo7G5BmoZmG8x3bR1
Status: I deposited real SOL to this address
Problem: Private key was NEVER saved to database - all funds are now inaccessible
Database Status: Query confirms ZERO wallet records exist

TECHNICAL FAILURES DOCUMENTED:
1. Mastra Framework Memory Failure:
   - Code called memory.saveMessages() to store encrypted private key
   - Function executed without errors but silently FAILED to persist data
   - PostgreSQL database contains zero wallet records despite successful wallet generation
   - File: src/mastra/tools/walletGeneratorTool.ts (lines 84-98)

2. Database Evidence:
   - Executed: SELECT * FROM mastra_messages WHERE thread_id LIKE '%wallet%'
   - Result: Empty (0 rows)
   - This confirms the private key was never saved despite code execution

3. User ID Bug:
   - userId parameter passed as string "user" instead of actual Telegram ID "7806554124"
   - This prevented proper user-wallet association
   - Root cause: Mastra framework limitation with runtimeContext in direct tool.execute() calls

4. AI Feature Violation:
   - I explicitly requested NO AI features to stay within budget
   - Initial implementation used expensive OpenAI GPT-4o calls
   - This directly violated my stated requirements and caused $165 in charges

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
1. FULL REFUND of all charges (~$600 total) - this exceeds my stated budget by 60x
2. SERVER LOG ANALYSIS to recover lost private key from logs/memory dumps
3. COMPENSATION for deposited cryptocurrency funds now stuck at wallet address 6vexNEjjuygFqvQehKyDBNCZ4WRRo7G5BmoZmG8x3bR1
4. INVESTIGATION into why Mastra memory.saveMessages() failed silently without error
5. IMMEDIATE RESPONSE - my funds are at risk

EVIDENCE AVAILABLE:
- Database queries showing zero wallet records
- Source code showing wallet generation logic (src/mastra/tools/walletGeneratorTool.ts)
- Encryption code showing private key should have been saved (src/mastra/tools/walletEncryption.ts)
- Billing statements showing $600+ in charges vs $5-10 expected
- Blockchain explorer showing deposited funds at wallet address

TIMELINE:
- Project started: Request for budget-constrained bot (NO AI, $5-10/month)
- Initial failure: $165 charge for unwanted AI features
- Wallet feature added: Generated wallet successfully
- Critical failure: Private key never saved to database
- Deposited funds: Sent real SOL to generated wallet address
- Discovery: Database query reveals zero wallet records
- Additional charges: ~$200 more in recent billing
- Current status: Funds inaccessible, total charges ~$600

SEVERITY:
This is a CRITICAL issue involving:
- Financial loss (60x budget overrun)
- Lost cryptocurrency funds (deposited to unrecoverable wallet)
- Silent system failures (no error messages despite data loss)
- Framework bugs (Mastra memory persistence failure)

I have been patient through multiple failures, but this situation requires immediate escalation. I need a response within 24 hours with a clear plan for:
1. Full refund processing
2. Private key recovery attempt
3. Root cause analysis of memory.saveMessages() failure
4. Compensation for lost deposited funds

Please treat this with the highest priority. I can provide additional technical details, database dumps, source code, or any other evidence needed.
