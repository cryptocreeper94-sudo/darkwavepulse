It compares the magnitude of recent gains to recent losses over a 14-day period to determine if an asset is overbought or oversold.\",\n    howToUse: \"RSI below 30 = OVERSOLD (potential buying opportunity - price may bounce). RSI above 70 = OVERBOUGHT (consider taking profits - correction likely). RSI 40-60 = neutral zone. Watch for divergence: if price makes new lows but RSI doesn't, that's a bullish signal suggesting the downtrend is weakening.\\n\\n🎯 COMBINING RSI WITH OTHER SIGNALS (Higher Accuracy):\\n• RSI <30 + Price at Support + Volume spike = STRONG BUY (triple confirmation)\\n• RSI >70 + Price at Resistance + MACD bearish cross = STRONG SELL\\n• RSI <30 + MACD bullish cross + Price above EMA 50 = Buy the dip in uptrend\\n• RSI divergence + Bollinger Band squeeze breaking up = High probability breakout\\n• RSI 40-60 + Price between EMAs = WAIT, no clear signal\\n\\nNever trade on RSI alone - always confirm with at least 2 other indicators.\",\n  },\n  MACD: {\n    definition: \"Moving Average Convergence Divergence - Shows the relationship between 12-day and 26-day exponential moving averages. Consists of three components: MACD line (12 EMA - 26 EMA), signal line (9-day EMA of MACD), and histogram (difference between MACD and signal).\",\n    howToUse: \"BULLISH SIGNALS: MACD crosses above signal line (buy signal), histogram turns positive, MACD crosses above zero line. BEARISH SIGNALS: MACD crosses below signal line (sell signal), histogram turns negative, MACD crosses below zero. Larger histogram bars = stronger momentum. Watch for MACD/price divergence - if price makes new highs but MACD doesn't, trend may be weakening.\\n\\n🎯 COMBINING MACD WITH OTHER SIGNALS:\\n• MACD bullish cross + RSI rising from <40 + Volume increasing = High conviction buy\\n• MACD above zero + Price above EMA 50 & 200 + Rising volume = Strong uptrend, hold position\\n• MACD bearish cross + RSI >70 + Price at resistance = Take profits\\n• MACD histogram shrinking + RSI divergence = Trend exhaustion, prepare to exit\\n• MACD flat + RSI 40-60 + Low volume = Consolidation, wait for breakout\\n\\nBest used with RSI and volume for confirmation. MACD alone can give false signals in choppy markets.\",\n  },\n  EMA: {\n    definition: \"Exponential Moving Average - A moving average that weighs recent prices more heavily than older prices, making it more responsive to new price action. Common periods: EMA 9 (very fast), EMA 21 (fast), EMA 50 (medium), EMA 200 (slow/long-term trend).\",\n    howToUse: \"Price ABOVE EMA = uptrend (bullish). Price BELOW EMA = downtrend (bearish). GOLDEN CROSS: Fast EMA (50) crosses above slow EMA (200) = strong buy signal. DEATH CROSS: Fast EMA crosses below slow EMA = strong sell signal. EMAs act as dynamic support/resistance - price often bounces off them. Multiple EMA strategy: when EMA 9 > EMA 21 > EMA 50 all aligned = strong trend, stay in the trade.\",\n  },\n  SMA: {\n    definition: \"Simple Moving Average - The arithmetic average of prices over a set period, giving equal weight to all data points. More stable than EMA but slower to react. Commonly used periods: SMA 20 (short-term), SMA 50 (medium-term), SMA 200 (long-term/major trend).\",\n    howToUse: \"Price crossing ABOVE SMA = bullish signal. Price crossing BELOW SMA = bearish signal. SMA 50/200 crossovers are powerful signals: 50 crossing above 200 = 'Golden Cross' (major buy signal), 50 crossing below 200 = 'Death Cross' (major sell signal). SMA 20 often used for support/resistance in trending markets. The 200 SMA is watched by institutional traders as a key level.\",\n  },\n  \"BOLLINGER BANDS\": {\n    definition: \"Bollinger Bands - Three lines: a 20-day SMA (middle), an upper band (middle + 2 standard deviations), and lower band (middle - 2 standard deviations). Bands expand during volatility and contract during consolidation. About 95% of price action occurs within the bands.\",\n    howToUse: \"Price at LOWER BAND = oversold, potential bounce (but confirm with RSI). Price at UPPER BAND = overbought, potential pullback. SQUEEZE: When bands narrow = low volatility, big move coming soon (direction unknown - wait for breakout). EXPANSION: Wide bands = high volatility, trend in progress. WALKING THE BAND: In strong trends, price can 'ride' the upper or lower band for extended periods. Bollinger Bounce strategy: buy at lower band in ranging market. Bollinger Breakout strategy: enter when price breaks outside bands with volume.\\n\\n🎯 MULTI-SIGNAL STRATEGY:\\n• BB Squeeze + RSI 40-60 + Low volume, THEN breakout + Volume spike = Trade the breakout direction\\n• Price at lower BB + RSI <30 + MACD turning up = Strong buy setup\\n• Walking upper band + RSI >80 + Volume declining = Exhaustion, exit soon\",\n  },\n  BB: {\n    definition: \"Bollinger Bands - Same as 'BOLLINGER BANDS' - see that entry for details.\",\n    howToUse: \"See 'BOLLINGER BANDS' for complete explanation and multi-signal strategies.\",\n  },\n  VOLUME: {\n    definition: \"Volume - The total number of units traded in a period. Measures market participation and conviction behind price moves. High volume = many traders agreeing on direction. Low volume = weak participation, moves can easily reverse. Volume should confirm price action.\",\n    howToUse: \"BULLISH VOLUME SIGNALS: Price rises + volume increases = strong uptrend (high conviction). Price breaks resistance + high volume = valid breakout (not fake). BEARISH SIGNALS: Price rises + volume decreases = weak rally (beware reversal). Price breaks support + high volume = strong breakdown. VOLUME DIVERGENCE: Price makes new high but volume declining = trend weakening, potential reversal. Volume spikes often mark market tops/bottoms. In crypto/DEX: Low volume = easy price manipulation, high slippage risk.\\n\\n🎯 VOLUME CONFIRMATION STRATEGIES:\\n• Breakout + 2x average volume + RSI >50 = Valid breakout, enter trade\\n• Price rise + Declining volume + RSI >70 = Weak rally, don't chase\\n• Support bounce + Volume spike + RSI <35 = Strong reversal signal\\n• Volume 50% below average + Any signal = Ignore the signal, wait for volume\",\n  },\n  \"SUPPORT\": {\n    definition: \"Support - A price level where buying demand is strong enough to overcome selling pressure and prevent further decline. Acts like a 'floor' under price. Forms at previous lows, psychological price levels (round numbers like $100), or moving averages. The more times price bounces off a level without breaking, the stronger the support.\",\n    howToUse: \"TRADING SUPPORT: Set buy orders slightly above support (confirmation). Place stop-loss just below support (if it breaks, exit). Support becomes RESISTANCE after breaking (role reversal). SUPPORT STRENGTH: Multiple bounces = stronger support. High volume bounces = stronger support. Longer timeframe support (weekly/monthly) stronger than daily. SUPPORT BREAKS: If price closes BELOW support on high volume = real break (expect further downside). False breaks (wicks below with close above) = strong support, often good entry.\",\n  },\n  \"RESISTANCE\": {\n    definition: \"Resistance - A price level where selling pressure overcomes buying and prevents further rise. Acts like a 'ceiling' above price. Forms at previous highs, psychological levels, or moving averages. The more rejections at a level, the stronger the resistance. Breaking resistance often leads to explosive moves as shorts cover and breakout buyers enter.\",\n    howToUse: \"TRADING RESISTANCE: Take profits near resistance in range-bound markets. Wait for confirmed breakout before buying (close ABOVE resistance on volume). Set stop-loss above resistance for short positions. RESISTANCE BREAKOUTS: Strong breakouts have high volume, large candles, no immediate pullback. Weak breakouts (low volume, small candles) often fail. After breakout, old resistance becomes new support (test this level). MULTIPLE REJECTIONS: 3+ rejections at same level = very strong resistance, big move when it finally breaks.\",\n  },\n  LIQUIDITY: {\n    definition: \"Liquidity - Ability to quickly buy/sell an asset without significantly moving its price. High liquidity = tight spreads, low slippage, instant execution. Low liquidity = wide spreads, high slippage, hard to exit. Measured by: trading volume, order book depth, number of active traders. For DEX pairs: liquidity pools determine how much can be traded without massive price impact.\",\n    howToUse: \"CHECKING LIQUIDITY: DEX pairs need $50k+ liquidity for safe trading ($100k+ is good, $500k+ excellent). Volume should be 10-50% of liquidity daily (higher = active, lower = dead coin). RISKS OF LOW LIQUIDITY: Your $1000 buy could pump price 20%, then you can't sell without crashing it. Whale dumps can crash price 50%+ instantly. Easy price manipulation by bots. SLIPPAGE: Set max slippage 1-3% for high liquidity, 5-10% for medium, avoid trading if you need >15% slippage. Always check liquidity BEFORE buying meme coins.\",\n  },\n  \"RUG RISK\": {\n    definition: \"Rug Risk - Probability that developers will abandon a project and drain liquidity, sending price to zero. Common in new/low-cap tokens and meme coins. Signs: unlocked liquidity, anonymous team, no contract verification, suspicious tokenomics (team holds >50%), very new token (<7 days old), no social media presence, unrealistic promises.\",\n    howToUse: \"ASSESSING RUG RISK: HIGH RISK = liquidity <$10k, <50 daily transactions, holders <100, token <3 days old, unlocked LP tokens. MODERATE RISK = liquidity $10-50k, contract unverified, low holder count. LOW RISK = liquidity >$100k locked for 6+ months, verified contract, distributed holders, established team. RED FLAGS: Developers can mint unlimited tokens, liquidity not locked, top 10 wallets hold >80%, honeypot contract (can't sell). PROTECTION: Never invest more than you can lose 100%. Always test sell small amount first. Check contract on token scanners. Exit strategy before entering.\",\n  },\n  SLIPPAGE: {\n    definition: \"Slippage - Difference between expected price and actual execution price. Happens because orders consume available liquidity at each price level. Example: You try to buy at $1.00, but execution happens at $1.05 = 5% slippage. More common in: low liquidity pairs, large orders, volatile markets, DEX swaps. Can work for or against you (positive slippage = better price than expected).\",\n    howToUse: \"SLIPPAGE SETTINGS: 0.1-0.5% = bluechip cryptos on major exchanges. 0.5-1% = established altcoins with good liquidity. 1-3% = smaller cap coins, DEX pairs. 5-15% = meme coins, new tokens (dangerous territory). >15% = avoid or you'll get rekt. REDUCING SLIPPAGE: Trade during high volume hours. Split large orders into smaller chunks. Use limit orders instead of market orders. Choose pairs with deep liquidity. FRONT-RUNNING: On DEX, bots can see your transaction and front-run you, increasing your slippage. This is why meme coin trades often execute worse than expected.\",\n  },\n  DEX: {\n    definition: \"DEX (Decentralized Exchange) - A cryptocurrency exchange that operates without a central authority, allowing peer-to-peer trading.\",\n    howToUse: \"DEXs like Uniswap, PancakeSwap offer more tokens but higher risk. Check liquidity and rug risk before trading. DEX pairs often have higher volatility than centralized exchanges.\",\n  },\n  \"MARKET CAP\": {\n    definition: \"Market Capitalization - The total value of all circulating tokens/shares, calculated as price × circulating supply.\",\n    howToUse: \"Higher market cap = more established and stable. Lower market cap = higher growth potential but higher risk. Compare market cap to liquidity to assess legitimacy.\",\n  },\n  FDV: {\n    definition: \"Fully Diluted Valuation - The theoretical market cap if all tokens were in circulation, calculated as price × total supply.\",\n    howToUse: \"If FDV is much higher than market cap, many tokens will be unlocked later (dilution risk). Compare FDV to current market cap to assess future selling pressure.\",\n  },\n  BULLISH: {\n    definition: \"Bullish - A market sentiment indicating expectation of rising prices. Opposite of bearish.\",\n    howToUse: \"Bullish signals suggest buying or holding. Look for: RSI recovery, MACD crossovers, price above moving averages, increasing volume.\",\n  },\n  BEARISH: {\n    definition: \"Bearish - A market sentiment indicating expectation of falling prices. Opposite of bullish.\",\n    howToUse: \"Bearish signals suggest selling or staying out. Look for: RSI decline, MACD negative crossovers, price below moving averages, decreasing volume.\",\n  },\n  OVERBOUGHT: {\n    definition: \"Overbought - A condition where an asset has risen too quickly and may be due for a correction or pullback.\",\n    howToUse: \"RSI above 70 or price above upper Bollinger Band indicates overbought. Consider taking profits or waiting for a pullback before buying.\",\n  },\n  OVERSOLD: {\n    definition: \"Oversold - A condition where an asset has fallen too quickly and may be due for a bounce or reversal.\",\n    howToUse: \"RSI below 30 or price below lower Bollinger Band indicates oversold. Consider buying at these levels for potential bounce plays.\",\n  },\n  MOMENTUM: {\n    definition: \"Momentum - The rate of acceleration of price movement. Strong momentum indicates a trend is likely to continue.\",\n    howToUse: \"MACD histogram and RSI measure momentum. Increasing momentum confirms trend strength. Decreasing momentum warns of potential reversal.\",\n  },\n  VOLATILITY: {\n    definition: \"Volatility - The degree of price fluctuation over time. Higher volatility means larger and faster price swings.\",\n    howToUse: \"High volatility = higher risk and reward. Bollinger Band width measures volatility. DEX pairs typically have much higher volatility than stocks.\",\n  },\n  CROSSOVER: {\n    definition: \"Crossover - When one indicator line crosses above or below another, signaling a potential trend change.\",\n    howToUse: \"EMA crossovers (fast over slow = bullish) and MACD crossovers (MACD over signal = bullish) are common buy/sell signals.\",\n  },\n  \"SIGNAL COMBINATION\": {\n    definition: \"Signal Combination - Using multiple technical indicators together to confirm trading decisions and improve accuracy. Single indicators can give false signals, but when 2-3 indicators align, the probability of success increases significantly.\",\n    howToUse: \"🎯 PROVEN MULTI-SIGNAL STRATEGIES:\\n\\n1. STRONG BUY Setup (80%+ accuracy):\\n   • RSI <30 (oversold)\\n   • MACD bullish crossover\\n   • Price bouncing off support\\n   • Volume spike (2x average)\\n   • Price above EMA 200\\n   = All 5 signals = High conviction buy\\n\\n2. STRONG SELL Setup:\\n   • RSI >70 (overbought)\\n   • MACD bearish crossover\\n   • Price rejected at resistance\\n   • Volume declining\\n   • Price below EMA 50\\n   = Exit or short position\\n\\n3. TREND CONFIRMATION (Stay in Trade):\\n   • MACD above zero line\\n   • RSI 50-70 range\\n   • Price above EMA 50 & 200\\n   • Volume steady or rising\\n   = Strong uptrend, hold position\\n\\n4. WARNING - Exit Soon:\\n   • RSI divergence (price up, RSI down)\\n   • MACD histogram shrinking\\n   • Volume declining on rallies\\n   • Price approaching resistance\\n   = Take profits, trend exhausting\\n\\n5. NO TRADE Zone (Wait):\\n   • RSI 40-60 (neutral)\\n   • MACD flat near zero\\n   • Price between EMAs\\n   • Low volume\\n   = Consolidation, wait for clear setup\\n\\nRULE OF THUMB: Need at least 3 confirming signals for high-probability trades. 1-2 signals = too risky, often false.\",\n  },\n  SIGNALS: {\n    definition: \"Same as SIGNAL COMBINATION - see that entry for complete multi-signal trading strategies.\",\n    howToUse: \"Type 'SIGNAL COMBINATION' to see proven strategies for combining RSI, MACD, Volume, Support/Resistance, and EMAs for higher accuracy trades.\",\n  },\n};\n\nexport const glossaryTool = createTool({\n  id: \"glossary-tool\",\n  description: \"Provides definitions and usage guidance for technical analysis terms.
