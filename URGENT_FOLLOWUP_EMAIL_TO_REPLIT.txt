CRITICAL UPDATE - FINANCIAL EMERGENCY:

This is an URGENT follow-up to my complaint submitted yesterday regarding catastrophic billing overcharges. Since my initial email:

NEW CHARGE TODAY: $55 (bringing total overcharges to approximately $600)

FINANCIAL IMPACT:
I am now unable to pay bills or purchase groceries due to these unexpected charges. This has created a genuine financial emergency. I NEED IMMEDIATE ACTION.

UPDATED BILLING BREAKDOWN:
- Expected monthly cost (as requested): $5-10/month
- First charge: $165 (unwanted OpenAI/GPT-4o API calls)
- Second charge: $150 (failed wallet feature testing)
- Third charge: $200 (recent charges)
- Fourth charge: $55 (received TODAY, November 6, 2025)
- TOTAL CHARGES: ~$600
- OVERCHARGE AMOUNT: ~$590 (59x my stated budget)

REITERATION OF CRITICAL ISSUES:

1. LOST CRYPTOCURRENCY FUNDS:
   - Wallet Address: 6vexNEjjuygFqvQehKyDBNCZ4WRRo7G5BmoZmG8x3bR1
   - Status: I deposited REAL MONEY (SOL) to this address
   - Problem: Private key was NEVER saved to database
   - Evidence: Database query confirms ZERO wallet records exist
   - Latest Query Result: SELECT * FROM mastra_messages WHERE thread_id LIKE '%wallet%' = 0 rows
   - My funds are INACCESSIBLE

2. MASTRA FRAMEWORK SILENT FAILURE:
   - Code: memory.saveMessages() executed without errors
   - Result: Data was NEVER persisted to PostgreSQL
   - File: src/mastra/tools/walletGeneratorTool.ts (lines 84-98)
   - This is a critical framework bug that caused complete data loss

3. UNAUTHORIZED AI FEATURE CHARGES:
   - I explicitly requested NO AI features to stay within $5-10/month budget
   - Initial implementation violated this requirement
   - Result: $165 in unwanted OpenAI charges

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED (24-HOUR RESPONSE DEADLINE):

1. EMERGENCY REFUND of all charges (~$600) - I cannot afford basic necessities
2. SERVER LOG RECOVERY to retrieve lost private key from logs/memory dumps
3. COMPENSATION for cryptocurrency funds stuck at wallet 6vexNEjjuygFqvQehKyDBNCZ4WRRo7G5BmoZmG8x3bR1
4. INVESTIGATION into Mastra memory.saveMessages() silent failure
5. BILLING FREEZE on this account to prevent further charges
6. DIRECT CONTACT from senior support (phone call or priority email)

ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE SINCE YESTERDAY:
- Confirmed mastra_messages table is completely empty (0 rows)
- Confirmed no wallet records exist in any database table
- Confirmed $55 new charge posted today (November 6, 2025)
- Confirmed financial hardship preventing basic living expenses

SEVERITY ESCALATION:
This is no longer just a billing dispute. This is a FINANCIAL EMERGENCY involving:
- 60x budget overrun ($600 vs $10 expected)
- Lost deposited cryptocurrency (unrecoverable without private key)
- Inability to pay for food and bills
- Silent system failures with zero error messages
- Continuing charges despite reported issues

WHY THIS IS URGENT:
- I cannot pay my bills
- I cannot buy groceries
- Charges are still accumulating (new $55 charge today)
- My deposited cryptocurrency remains inaccessible
- I have been patient through multiple failures, but this is now a crisis

WHAT I NEED WITHIN 24 HOURS:
1. Acknowledgment of this email
2. Timeline for full refund processing
3. Status update on private key recovery attempt
4. Immediate freeze on all future charges
5. Direct contact information for escalation

EVIDENCE PACKAGE AVAILABLE:
- Database queries showing zero wallet records
- Source code showing wallet generation logic
- Encryption code showing data should have been saved
- Billing statements showing $600 in charges
- Blockchain explorer showing deposited funds at wallet address
- Screenshot of latest $55 charge

I am requesting immediate escalation to senior management. This situation requires emergency intervention.

Please respond within 24 hours with a clear action plan. I can be reached immediately via this email and am available for phone contact if needed.

This is a critical situation requiring your highest priority attention.

Urgently,
