## 📝 Content Templates (Copy & Customize)

### **Twitter Thread Template (Educational)**
```
🧵 Most traders lose money because they ignore ONE key indicator.

Let me explain RSI (and why you should care):

1/ RSI = Relative Strength Index
It measures if an asset is overbought or oversold.

Think of it like a thermometer for price momentum.

2/ RSI above 70? → Overbought (might drop soon)
RSI below 30? → Oversold (might bounce)

But here's the catch most people miss...

3/ RSI alone is NOT enough.
You need MACD, volume, and sentiment too.

That's why I built @DarkWavePulse - it combines all 3 for you.

4/ Free trial: [link]
No credit card needed. Just pure technical analysis.

### **Crypto Cat Personality Post**
```
*stretches lazily*

Another day, another 50 people asking me if they should buy [insert random memecoin].

Look, I'm just a cat. But even I know to check RSI before yeeting my treats into the void.

Try not to be dumber than a cat today. 🐱

### **Engagement Post (Polls)**
```
Quick poll for crypto traders:

What indicator do you trust MOST?

🟢 MACD

Title: Built a free technical analysis bot for crypto (no BS, just signals)

Body:
Hey everyone,

I'm a developer who got tired of paying $50/month for basic TA tools.

So I built DarkWave - a Telegram bot that analyzes crypto and stocks with RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.

It's free to use. No ads. No data selling.

Features:
- Real-time analysis
- Portfolio tracking
- Price alerts
- Works with 1000+ coins

Try it: [link]

Feedback welcome!

(Mods: let me know if this violates any rules, happy to adjust)
```

### **Telegram Groups (Join & Engage)**

**How to find groups:**
1. Search Telegram for "crypto trading"
2. Join 10-20 groups (500-5000 members each)
3. **DON'T SPAM** - provide value first

**Engagement strategy:**
```
Day 1-3: Just listen and learn
Day 4-7: Answer questions when you can
Week 2: Share helpful TA insights
Week 3: Mention "I built a bot that helps with this" when RELEVANT
```

**Good groups to join:**
- Crypto Signals (search for this)
- Technical Analysis Trading
- Solana Ecosystem
- DeFi Community

### **Twitter Engagement (15 min/day)**

**Daily routine:**
1. Search "#crypto" + sort by Latest
2. Find 10 tweets asking for advice
3. Give helpful answer + mention your tool

**Example:**
```
User tweet: "Should I buy BTC at $43K? RSI looks high..."

Your reply: 
"RSI is 72, which is overbought territory. But check MACD too - if it's positive, the momentum might continue.

I built a free bot that combines both: [link]

Not financial advice, DYOR!"
```

## 🚀 Batch Sending (Free Tools)
