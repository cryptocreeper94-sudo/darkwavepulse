## System Architecture

### Frontend
The frontend is built with React 19 and Vite 7, loading external utility scripts (CSS, themes, gauges, chart managers) from the public directory. It provides a modern user interface with a CoinMarketCap-style market overview, a 9-column data table, and 7 distinct category tabs. The design incorporates a Crypto.com-style aesthetic with dark navy backgrounds, a three-column responsive grid, elevated cards, and angular dividers.

The application features a personalized 9-theme system with organic CSS gradient patterns, maintaining layout consistency while changing color schemes. The Crypto Cat mascot is toggleable, offering varied personality and commentary. A banner system is used across pages.

### Backend and AI Agent
The core AI agent, DarkWave-V2, is powered by the Mastra framework, enabling tool calling, memory management, and natural language processing. Workflow orchestration uses `createWorkflow` and `createStep` for deterministic execution. A modular tool system (`createTool`) with Zod schemas encapsulates specific functionalities like Market Data, Technical Analysis, Holdings, Scanner, Chart Generation, Dexscreener, DEX Analysis (including rug-risk detection), and NFT Tool.

### Language Model Integration
The system integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini via Replit AI Integrations using the `generateLegacy` method from `@ai-sdk/openai`.

### Data Flow
The message processing pipeline involves Telegram webhooks, Inngest for event-driven workflow execution, the Mastra agent, and subsequent response formatting.

### Technical Implementation
The project utilizes TypeScript with strict mode and ES2022. Zod schemas provide runtime validation for all tool inputs/outputs. Pino logger is used for structured JSON logging. Security features include browser-generated unique user IDs, an admin dashboard, and robust file upload validation. Access control supports both an access code and an email whitelist, with pricing tiers including Free Trial, Basic, and Premium. Live data performance is optimized with 5-minute browser caching.

### Feature Specifications
Key features include DEX pair support with rug-risk detection and liquidity scoring, NFT collection analysis, a live trending carousel, and database-backed session management. It supports tracked, multi-chain wallets (Solana, Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, BSC). The system includes a subscription notification system, an admin dashboard, a professional token submission system with three-layer file validation, and cryptocurrency payments via Coinbase Commerce. A DarkWave Token Launchpad provides a live countdown, whitelist signup, and premium-gated access. A "Bot Detection System" is implemented for DEX pair rug risk analysis.

### UI/UX Decisions
The UI features a CoinMarketCap-style market overview with a 9-column data table and 7 distinct category tabs. It incorporates a Crypto.com-style design overhaul with dark navy backgrounds, a three-column responsive grid, elevated cards, and angular dividers. An enhanced color scheme uses electric blue accents with gold and purple highlights. A personalized 9-theme system offers subtle organic CSS gradient patterns. The Crypto Cat mascot provides toggleable, sarcastic commentary. The system enforces consistent box sizing, margins, padding, and font sizes across the UI for a low-profile, compact design, favoring double-column layouts.
