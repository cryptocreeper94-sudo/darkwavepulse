# Pulse - AI Crypto Trading & News Platform

## Overview
Pulse, by DarkWave Studios, LLC, is an AI-driven cryptocurrency trading platform that leverages the Mastra AI framework to deliver predictive signals, quant trading analysis, and comprehensive crypto news/information. The platform focuses exclusively on cryptocurrency, with all DWC coin and staking functionality handled by DarkWave Smart Chain (DSC), a separate L1 blockchain.

## User Preferences
- Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language
- Always check with Jason before proceeding to verify any task - confirm changes look correct before moving on
- Agent diversity: Equal distribution across age groups, gender, race, and hair color
- Design aesthetic: Solid black/dark gray backgrounds (#0f0f0f, #1a1a1a, #141414) with free-floating elements featuring glow effects. Glassmorphism (backdrop-filter blur + semi-transparent backgrounds) is ALLOWED for cards site-wide, but NOT for backgrounds, buttons, or other non-card elements.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform utilizes a dark theme exclusively, featuring solid black/dark gray backgrounds and free-floating elements with glow effects. Glassmorphism is permitted only for cards. Key UI components include a slim 50px header, dynamic footer, SVG gauge components, metric cards, and a customizable Bitcoin chart using `lightweight-charts`. The design avoids frames, and the color palette strictly excludes orange, yellow, and brown.
