# Pulse - AI Trading Analysis Platform

## Overview
Pulse, by DarkWave Studios, LLC, is an AI-driven trading platform that leverages the Mastra AI framework to deliver predictive signals and institutional-grade technical analysis for cryptocurrency and stocks. Its core purpose is to provide users with a competitive edge by identifying market trends early and offering sophisticated, risk-adjusted analytics. The platform integrates with the broader DarkWave Studios ecosystem, powered by the DWAV token, aiming to empower traders with advanced AI capabilities and significant market potential.

## User Preferences
- Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language
- Always check with Jason before proceeding to verify any task - confirm changes look correct before moving on
- Agent diversity: Equal distribution across age groups, gender, race, and hair color
- Design aesthetic: Solid black/dark gray backgrounds (#0f0f0f, #1a1a1a, #141414) with free-floating elements featuring glow effects. Glassmorphism (backdrop-filter blur + semi-transparent backgrounds) is ALLOWED for cards site-wide, but NOT for backgrounds, buttons, or other non-card elements.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a solid dark theme with free-floating elements and glow effects. Glassmorphism is used for cards, but not for backgrounds, buttons, or other non-card elements. The design includes a slim 50px header, a dynamic footer, SVG gauge components, metric cards, and a customizable Bitcoin chart using `lightweight-charts`. UI elements avoid frames, with agents appearing as if walking in front of a screen. The color palette strictly avoids orange, yellow, and brown. A light mode theme is also implemented.
