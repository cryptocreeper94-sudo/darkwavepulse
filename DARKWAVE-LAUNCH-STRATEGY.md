3. **Don't fake engagement** - Real users > bot followers
4. **Don't rush compliance** - Make sure token launch is legal
5. **Don't ignore feedback** - Early users tell you what's broken

---

## 💡 Your Secret Weapon

**You have a working product.** Most crypto tokens launch with:
- Just a whitepaper
- No utility
- Pure speculation

**DarkWave has:**
- ✅ Live Telegram bot
- ✅ Technical analysis that works
- ✅ Real users getting value
- ✅ Multi-revenue model

**Lead with utility, not hype.** Show people the bot works FIRST, then tell them about the token. Flip the script on traditional crypto launches.
