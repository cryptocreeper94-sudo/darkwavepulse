## The Problem

### Retail Traders Are Disadvantaged

The cryptocurrency and stock markets are dominated by institutional players with access to:

- **Advanced Analytics**: Proprietary algorithms and machine learning systems
- **Real-Time Data**: Premium market feeds and analysis tools
- **Dedicated Research Teams**: Analysts monitoring markets 24/7
- **Risk Management Systems**: Sophisticated portfolio protection

Meanwhile, retail traders face:

1. **Information Asymmetry**: Hours behind institutional players
2. **Analysis Paralysis**: Too much data, not enough insight
3. **Emotional Trading**: Fear and greed drive poor decisions
4. **Fragmented Tools**: Multiple platforms, no unified view
5. **Security Risks**: Vulnerable to scams and hacks

### The Result

**90% of retail traders lose money.** Not because they're unintelligent, but because they lack the tools that institutions take for granted.

---

## The Solution

### PULSE: AI-Powered Trading Intelligence

PULSE democratizes access to institutional-grade analytics through:

5. **Educational Resources**: 8-chapter trading guide and 143-term glossary for trader development

### Why This Matters

## Token Economics

### Token Specifications

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | DWT Token |
| **Symbol** | DWT |
| **Network** | Solana (SPL Token) |
| **Total Supply** | 100,000,000 DWT |
| **Decimals** | 9 |
| **Launch Date** | February 14, 2026 |

### Why 100 Million?

We chose a professional supply of 100 million tokens—not billions or trillions like meme tokens. This signals:

- **Serious Utility**: Real value per token, not fractions of fractions
- **Professional Positioning**: Aligned with established utility tokens like AAVE (16M), MKR (1M), COMP (10M)
- **Scarcity Messaging**: "100 million total supply" communicates value

### Tax Structure

| Transaction | Tax Rate | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Buy** | 0% | Encourage accumulation |
| **Sell** | 5% | Revenue generation |
| **Transfer** | 5% | Anti-manipulation |

**Tax Distribution:**
- 2% Treasury (development, operations)
- 2% Liquidity Pool (price stability)
- 1% Marketing (growth, partnerships)

### Token Allocation

| Category | Amount | % | Vesting |
|----------|--------|---|---------|
| Public Sale | 40,000,000 | 40% | None |
| Team | 15,000,000 | 15% | 6-month cliff, 12-month vest |
| Development | 20,000,000 | 20% | Unlocked as needed |
| Marketing | 10,000,000 | 10% | Unlocked |
| Liquidity | 10,000,000 | 10% | Locked in DEX |
| Reserve | 5,000,000 | 5% | 12-month lock |
