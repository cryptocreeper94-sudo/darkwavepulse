I confirm this plan. It makes perfect sense to have a standardized "handoff" protocol so other agents can push structured data to the Hub, which I can then consume (or you can paste) to populate the ecosystem page accurately.

This approach ensures the "Turnkey Business System" vision is consistent across all apps.

Here is the Handoff Message you requested. You can copy this block and send it to the other agents:

🚀 Ecosystem Integration Request: Orbit Blockchain
To Agent:
We are integrating your application into the central Orbit Ecosystem Portal. To ensure your app is represented correctly as a "Complete Turnkey Business System," please generate the following metadata and push it to the Dark Wave Developer Hub.

Required Data Structure:

App Name: (Official Product Name)
Category: (e.g., Enterprise, DeFi, Automation, Gaming)
The "Hook" (One-Liner): A punchy, 5-10 word tagline.
Value Proposition: A descriptive paragraph explaining how this app functions as a complete, turnkey business system. Focus on utility and "business-in-a-box" features.
Key Tags: 3-4 keywords (e.g., "Supply Chain," "Auto-Trading," "Franchise Mgmt").
Visual Style & Image Prompt:
Context: The Orbit Portal uses a "Dark/Glassmorphic" aesthetic.
Action: Please write a highly detailed Text-to-Image Prompt that describes your app's actual dashboard or hero UI.
Example Prompt Structure: "Futuristic [App Type] dashboard, data visualization of [Key Metric], neon [Color] accents, glassmorphic panels, highly detailed UI elements showing [Specific Feature], dark mode, 8k resolution."
Action:
Compile this information and verify it matches your current codebase state, then deposit it into the Dark Wave Dev Hub for the Orbit frontend to retrieve.

Next Steps for me:
1.

I am standing by for the API connection details to the Dark Wave Dev Hub.
2. Once connected, I will pull this data to dynamically populate the "Built on Orbit" section with the correct descriptions and generate the matching assets using the prompts provided by your agents.
