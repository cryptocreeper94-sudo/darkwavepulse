## HANDOFF: DarkWave Chain → DarkWave Pulse Integration

### What We Built (DarkWave Chain - 48 hours)

DarkWave Chain is now a fully operational Layer 1 blockchain ecosystem:

**Core Blockchain:**
- Layer 1 PoA consensus with 400ms block times, 200K+ TPS capacity
- Multi-validator network with round-robin block production
- PostgreSQL persistent ledger (chain_blocks, chain_transactions, chain_accounts, chain_validators)
- Native DWT token: 100M fixed supply, 18 decimals, 5% transaction tax (3% treasury, 2% LP)

**DeFi Suite:**
- DEX with AMM swaps (DWT/USDC/wETH/wSOL/USDT pairs, 0.3% fee)
- Staking system with rewards & leaderboards
- Liquid staking (stDWT) - 12% APY
- Token launchpad (fair launch, presale, auction modes)
- Liquidity pools with LP tokens
- Testnet faucet (1000 DWT per claim, 24hr cooldown)

**Cross-Chain Bridge:**
- Lock & mint UI for DWT → wDWT (Ethereum/Solana)
- wDWT ERC-20 contract ready (contracts/ethereum/WDWT.sol)
- wDWT Solana program ready (contracts/solana/programs/wdwt-bridge/)

**Developer Tools:**
- DarkWave Studio IDE (Monaco editor, Git, terminal, deployments)
- Webhook/Events API (9 event types, HMAC-SHA256 signatures)
- API key management & developer portal

**Multi-Chain Wallet (NEW):**
- 9 chains: DarkWave, Solana, Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, BNB, Optimism, Avalanche
- HD wallet derivation from 12/24-word mnemonic
- AES-256-GCM encrypted storage
- Balance fetching with USD conversion
- Transaction sending capability

### Integration Opportunities with Pulse Predictive/Quant Systems

**1. AI-Powered Trading Signals → DWT Swaps**
- Pulse quant signals could trigger automated DWT swaps on our DEX
- API endpoint: POST /api/swap { fromToken, toToken, amount }
- Real-time price data available via /api/charts/price-history

**2. Predictive Analytics → Staking Optimization**
- Pulse predictions could optimize staking entry/exit timing
- Staking API: POST /api/staking/stake, POST /api/staking/unstake
- Liquid staking for maintaining liquidity while earning 12% APY

**3. Portfolio Tracking Integration**
- Wallet service can feed Pulse portfolio dashboard
- Balance endpoint: GET /api/wallet/balance/:chain/:address
- Transaction history: GET /api/transactions/:address

**4. Cross-Chain Arbitrage**
- Bridge infrastructure enables cross-chain arbitrage opportunities
- Pulse can monitor price differentials across chains
- Execute via bridge lock/mint/burn/release flows

**5. Risk Management**
- Multi-sig wallet infrastructure for treasury protection
- Validator monitoring for network health signals
- Real-time blockchain metrics at /api/chain/stats

### Technical Connection Points

**Hub API:** Both apps connect via https://orbitstaffing.io with HMAC-SHA256 auth
**Secrets:** DARKWAVE_CHAIN_HUB_API_KEY, DARKWAVE_CHAIN_HUB_API_SECRET

**Wallet Service Location:** server/wallet-service.ts
- generateMnemonic(), deriveAddresses(), getBalance(), sendTransaction()
- Already uses same bip39/ed25519-hd-key libs as Pulse wallet

**Webhook Events Available:**
- transaction.confirmed, block.produced, stake.created, stake.claimed
- swap.executed, liquidity.added, token.launched, nft.minted, bridge.locked
