## Token Launch Economics

### DWAV Token Sale Strategy

**No Pre-Sale, No VC Allocation**

Instead of traditional fundraising:
- 20% allocated to liquidity pool at launch
- Community earns tokens through participation
- Team tokens locked 12 months
- Treasury controlled by DAO

### Revenue from Token Economy

| Source | Estimated Monthly |
|--------|-------------------|
| Transaction fees (0.5%) | $5,000-$20,000 |
| Staking platform fees | $2,000-$10,000 |
| NFT sales | $1,000-$5,000 |

*Estimates based on $10M-$50M token trading volume*
